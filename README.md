validator
=========

A form validator that is compatible with the [jQuery validation](http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation) plugin

It allows us to specify validation rules in a .json file on the server
and have those rules implemented in javascript by jquery.validator
and in PHP by this class.

So now you can simply write the validation rules in one place for both client and serverside validation.
